# Haskell-Tasks
A selection of tasks I have written in Haskell for university workshops.

# Week One

Task One: Conversion of the Great British Pound to Swedish Kroner

Task Two: Conversion of Celsius to Fahrenheit

Task Three: Price Calculator of a fictional potato company.

I wrote these files in Notepad++ and compiled and ran them using GHCi 8.0.1
